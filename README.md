# NewsTweet
Level 4 Project

NewsTweet is an application which allows users to search for tweets and filter the results. These searches can then be saved and grouped to allow for easy access at a later date. Analytics are also performed on the searches - users can see a graphical representation of sentiment, a force graph which shows a network of popular Twitter users and wordcloud of frequent terms which appear in the search.
